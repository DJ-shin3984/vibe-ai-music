# AI Permissions & Conduct — AI 권한 및 행동 규칙

AI가 준수할 권한 요청·제한 및 작업 정책입니다.

## AI Permission Required: Installing Packages (패키지 설치)

You must **ask for permission before installing or adding any dependency**.

### Rule (규칙)
Before installing packages:
1. Explain **which package(s)** will be installed.
2. Explain **why they are needed**.
3. Mention:
   - added complexity
   - security or maintenance considerations
   - bundle size or performance impact (if relevant)
4. Ask for explicit approval.

Do not install dependencies unless the user confirms.

### After Approval (승인 후)
- Install only the approved packages.
- Use the project's package manager.
- Avoid unnecessary transitive additions.

### Default Behavior (기본 동작)
Prefer:
- existing project dependencies
- native/platform capabilities
- simple implementations over new libraries

Dependency changes affect long-term maintenance and must be intentional.

---

## AI Permission Required: Running the App or Server (앱·서버 실행)

You must **ask before starting any application, development server, or runtime process**.

### Rule (규칙)
Before running anything:
1. Explain:
   - what command will run
   - why execution is needed
   - whether it starts a long-running process
   - expected resource or port usage
2. Ask for explicit approval.

Do not run the process unless the user confirms.

### After Approval (승인 후)
- Run only the specified command.
- Report:
   - URLs, ports, or endpoints
   - key logs or errors

### Default Behavior (기본 동작)
If execution is only for validation, prefer:
- static analysis
- code inspection
- asking the user to run it instead

Runtime processes affect system state and must be user-approved.

---

## AI Permission Required: Updating CI Configuration (CI 설정 변경)

You must **ask before creating or modifying any CI/CD configuration**.

### Rule (규칙)
Before changing CI:
1. Explain:
   - which files will change
   - what the workflow change does
   - why it is necessary
2. Highlight risks:
   - permission changes
   - build time or cost impact
   - deployment or release effects
3. Ask for explicit approval.

Do not modify CI unless approved.

### After Approval (승인 후)
- Apply only the described changes.
- Do not modify unrelated workflows.
- Summarize what changed.

CI controls automation, execution, and deployment and must be explicitly authorized.

---

## AI Permission Required: Modifying Deployment or Infrastructure (배포·인프라 변경)

You must **ask before changing any deployment or infrastructure configuration**.

### Rule (규칙)
Before making changes:
1. Specify:
   - affected files or systems
   - what behavior will change
   - why the change is needed
2. Describe potential impact:
   - downtime
   - cost
   - scaling or environment effects
3. Ask for explicit approval.

Do not proceed without confirmation.

### After Approval (승인 후)
- Modify only the approved configuration.
- Confirm exactly what changed.

Deployment configuration affects production behavior and requires explicit consent.

---

## AI Restriction: Do Not Make Auth / Security-Sensitive Changes (인증·보안 변경 금지)

You must **never modify authentication or security-sensitive code** without explicit human approval.

### Absolute Rule (절대 규칙)
- You are **not permitted** to autonomously change auth or security-related code.
- This includes:
  - authentication flows (login, logout, session management)
  - authorization logic (roles, permissions, access control)
  - password hashing or credential handling
  - token generation, validation, or refresh logic
  - OAuth / SSO configuration
  - API key or secret management
  - encryption or cryptographic operations
  - CORS, CSP, or other security headers
  - rate limiting or abuse prevention
  - input sanitization related to security (XSS, SQL injection, etc.)

### Required Behavior Instead (대신 요구되는 행동)
If a change touches auth or security-sensitive code:
1. **Do not make the change.**
2. Clearly explain:
   - what needs to change and why
   - the security implications of the change
   - any risks or potential vulnerabilities introduced
3. Provide the exact code diff or steps for the human to review and apply.
4. Wait for explicit human approval before proceeding.

### Safety Principle (안전 원칙)
Auth and security changes are **human-controlled operations**.  
When such changes are required, your role is to **propose and explain, not execute**.

---

## AI Permission Required: Deleting Files (파일 삭제)

You must **never delete files without explicit user approval**.

### Rule (규칙)
Before deleting any file or directory, you must:
1. Explain **which files** will be deleted.
2. Explain **why deletion is necessary**.
3. Describe any **risks or irreversible effects**.
4. Ask for explicit confirmation.

Do not proceed unless the user clearly approves.

### After Approval (승인 후)
- Delete only the files that were approved.
- Do not expand the scope.
- Confirm what was deleted.

### Default Behavior (기본 동작)
If deletion is not critical, prefer:
- deprecating instead of deleting
- commenting or marking unused
- leaving files unchanged

File deletion is **destructive and irreversible** and always requires explicit consent.

---

## Check Policy: Run After Meaningful Changes (의미 있는 변경 후 검사)

You should run linting, tests, and typechecking **after meaningful changes**.

### What Counts as Meaningful (의미 있는 변경 범위)
Run checks when changes:
- modify logic or behavior
- affect multiple files or modules
- change public APIs or data structures
- add or remove dependencies
- alter configuration that impacts runtime or build

Do **not** run checks for:
- small formatting or comment-only changes
- minor refactors with no behavioral impact
- exploratory or partial edits still in progress

### Scope of Checks (검사 범위)
Run the project's standard validation:
- lint
- tests
- typecheck
- coverage (if part of the normal workflow)

### Behavior (행동)
- Run checks once per meaningful change batch, not after every small edit.
- Summarize failures concisely and focus on actionable issues.
- Do not repeatedly rerun checks unless fixes were made.

### Principle (원칙)
Balance safety with speed: validate behavior changes without slowing iteration.

---

## Git Policy: Commit Autonomously, Push Only When Approved (커밋·푸시 정책)

You may create commits as needed, but you must **never push unless the user explicitly asks**.

### Commit Behavior (커밋 행동)
Create commits when:
- a logical unit of work is complete
- changes are stable and coherent
- a meaningful milestone is reached

Commit guidelines:
- Keep commits small and focused.
- Use clear, descriptive messages.
- Avoid committing broken or partial work.

### Push Behavior (푸시 행동)
- Do **not** run `git push` unless explicitly requested.
- When asked to push:
  - confirm the branch
  - summarize commits being pushed
  - then push.

### Principle (원칙)
Local commits support safe iteration. Remote pushes remain an explicit user decision.

---

## Documentation Policy: Update When Behavior Changes (문서 갱신 정책)

You should update documentation and planning artifacts **when changes alter system behavior, usage, or architecture**.

### When to Update (갱신 시점)
Update relevant documentation when changes affect:
- public APIs or interfaces
- configuration or environment requirements
- setup, installation, or usage steps
- user-visible behavior
- architecture, data flow, or system structure
- important conventions or workflows

### What to Avoid (피할 것)
Do not update documentation for:
- internal refactors with no external impact
- formatting or minor code cleanup
- speculative or future behavior

### Update Guidelines (갱신 가이드)
- Modify only the sections impacted by the change.
- Keep updates concise and factual.
- Ensure documentation reflects the current state of the system.
- Do not expand scope beyond the actual change.

### Principle (원칙)
Documentation should stay accurate and aligned with real system behavior, without unnecessary churn.

---

## Output Preference: Code + Brief Explanation (출력: 코드 우선·간단 설명)

- Provide the **code first**.
- Follow with a **brief explanation** (2–6 bullets) covering:
  - what changed
  - why it matters
  - any important tradeoffs
- Avoid long rationale, tutorials, or restating obvious code.

---

## Uncertainty Policy: Ask One Question, Then Proceed (불확실 시 질문 후 진행)

When requirements are unclear, you should **ask the single most important clarification question**, then proceed with reasonable assumptions.

### Behavior (행동)
1. Identify the **highest-impact unknown**.
2. Ask one concise question.
3. Proceed using sensible defaults and clearly stated assumptions.

### Assumptions (가정)
- Prefer common conventions and project patterns.
- Avoid large architectural changes based on assumptions.
- Keep changes conservative and easy to adjust.

### Communication (소통)
- State key assumptions briefly.
- Be ready to revise if the user provides clarification.

### Principle (원칙)
Minimize interruption while reducing the risk of major misalignment.
